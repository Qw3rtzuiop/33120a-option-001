<span style="color:red">This board has problems with fw rev.7 of the HP 33120a. I'm still investigating. Upgrading to rev.8 requieres desoldering of the PLCC32 memory.</span>

The ocxo is a used Vectron C4550A1-0213 (10 MHz, 5V).

The PCB is mounted on the side. You need to drill holes into the metal to mount the PCB. The pics show the rev. 0 with two bodge wires.
